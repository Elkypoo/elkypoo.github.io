        <p class="left" style="height: 20%;">Playing competitive Team
            Fortress 2 can be a very
            rewarding experience. When playing competitively, you improve drastically at the game, meet new friends,
            and learn
            things you would never have learned if you hadn't tried.
            <br><br>TF2 is also very unique in that its skill cap is incredibly high, so once you start, you can
            continue to
            improve at the game for years before becoming bored.
            <br><br>Whether you start playing competitively because you were looking for a game to get better at,
            because you
            wanted to play with your friends, or because you wanted to be good enough to crush your friends, TF2 and
            its
            competitive community will continue to suffice your competitive needs. With a cooperative community, tons
            upon
            <strong>tons</strong> of helpful resources, and many, many more things, you're sure to have an enjoyable
            time.<br></p>

        <h2>Aren't I too bad to play competitively?</h2>
        <img src="images/gibus.png" class="index">
        <p class="right" style="height: 20%;">Of course not! It's not like
            you'll be playing against the world's best players as soon as you start! As stated in the previous
            paragraph, there
            are many resources to help newer players get into competitive TF2 ranging from information sites, to PUG
            (pick-up
            game) groups, to helpful YouTube channels and series. Competitive doesn't mean that everyone is good, it
            just means
            that everyone is trying to win. As long as you try hard to win or improve, you're a competitive player!</p>
        <p class="line"></p>
        <p class="center bridge">Now that you're convinced, you're probably looking for ways to get involved in the
            competitive scene. Luckily enough, we do more than convince people to play it!<br><br>If you already have a
            group of friends you'd like to play on a team with, great work! If not, that's fine too, as you'll get to
            make more friends! </p>
