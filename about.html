        <p class="left" style="height: 20%;">Frag Academy was originally created on November 28, 2017, but it had only been created to be a PUG group for newer players.</p>

        <p class="right" style="height: 20%;">Of course not! It's not like
            you'll be playing against the world's best players as soon as you start! As stated in the previous
            paragraph, there
            are many resources to help newer players get into competitive TF2 ranging from information sites, to PUG
            (pick-up
            game) groups, to helpful YouTube channels and series. 
            
            <br><br>Competitive doesn't mean that everyone is good, it
            just means
            that everyone is trying to win. As long as you try hard to win or improve, you're a competitive player!</p>
        <p class="line"></p>
        <p class="center bridge">Now that you're convinced, you're probably looking for ways to get involved in the
            competitive scene. Luckily enough, we do more than convince people to play it!<br><br>If you already have a
            group of friends you'd like to play on a team with, great work! If not, that's fine too, as you'll get to
            make more friends! </p>
