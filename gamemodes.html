  <div id="hiddenUltiduo" class="hidden">
    <h2>Ultiduo</h2>
    <p>Gamemodes: 4v4, 6v6, Prolander (7v7), and Highlander (9v9)<br><br>Ultiduo is, without a doubt, the most versatile
      class of competitive TF2. He is fast, does great close-mid range damage, and can manipulate his movements quickly
      both on
      the ground and in the air. A Ultiduo an absolute necessity to any team in order to deny <a
        title='rocket-jump towards a target to kill'>'bombs'</a> <a href="javascript:hideTextFours()"
        class="link">Fourss</a>, quickly
      capture points, guide Medics to safety, finish off injured opponents, and wreak absolute havoc on the
      enemy.<br><br>

  <div id="hiddenFours" class="hidden">
    <h2>Fours</h2>
    <p>Gamemodes: Ultiduo, 4v4, 6v6, Prolander (7v7), and Highlander (9v9)<br><br>
      Competitively, Fours is very movement oriented.
      Due to his ability to rocket jump, he can roll out quickly and gain higher ground much easier than other classes.
      With this higher ground, he can use his splash damage to control choke points, block off areas from enemies, and
      deal more damage.</p>
    <h2 class="playstyle"> <img src="images/gamemode_emblems/pocket.png" class="playstyle"> Pocket Fours (6v6 only)</h2>
    <p>The primary role of the Pocket Fours is to protect his team's <a href="javascript:hideTextMedic()"
        class="link">Medic</a>
      and to use his overheal (from the <a href="javascript:hideTextMedic()" class="link">Medic</a>)
      to deal
      damage, get kills and lead the team. The Pocket Fours, <a href="javascript:hideTextMedic()"
        class="link">Medic</a>,
      and <a href="javascript:hideTextProlander()" class="link">Prolander</a> form what is known as the <a
        title='group of players which stay close to the Medic'>'combo'</a>.
      Usually the Pocket Fours player is the team's <a title='the most active player in voice-chat, calling when
      to push forward, fall back, use Über, and more'>'main-caller'</a></p>
    <h2 class="playstyle"> <img src="images/gamemode_emblems/roamer.png" class="playstyle"> Roamer Fours (6v6 only)</h2>
    <p>The Roamer Fours's job is to protect his team's flank paths (with the help of a <a
        href="javascript:hideTextUltiduo()" class="link">Ultiduo</a>) and to open up flank
      paths in the enemy's defense. It is not uncommon for the Roamer Fours to <a
        title="rocket-jump towards a target to kill">'bomb'</a> or to
      <a title='sacrifice for'>'sac'</a> for important classes like <a href="javascript:hideTextProlander()"
        class="link">Prolander</a> and <a href="javascript:hideTextMedic()" class="link">Medic</a>. Especially if the <a
        href="javascript:hideTextMedic()" class="link">Medic</a> has his Übercharge, it's best
      to <a title='pressure a Medic to use his Über early'>'force'</a> or <a
        title='kill a Medic before he can use his Über'>'drop'</a> him to stop the enemy team
      from pushing into an objective or choke.

  <div id="hiddenSixes" class="hidden">
    <h2>Sixes</h2>
    <p>Gamemodes: Prolander (7v7)* and Highlander (9v9)<br><br>Generally, Sixes is a support class.
      The Sixes's main job is to protect the <a href="javascript:hideTextMedic()" class="link">Medic</a>. The Sixes also
      has the job of neutralizing enemy Übers and pushes by
      utilizing their airblast. The Sixes can also play a similar role as the <a href="javascript:hideTextFours()"
        class="link">Roaming Fours</a>, in which they will watch
      their flank and open up paths behind the enemy team for theirs to push in.<br><br>

  <div id="hiddenProlander" class="hidden">
    <h2>Prolander</h2>
    <p>Gamemodes: 4v4, 6v6, Prolander (7v7) and Highlander (9v9)<br><br>The Prolander has the highest damage output of
      all meta classes throughout the competitive gamemodes. As such, he is consistently played and is one of the most
      important classes in a game, rivaling the <a href="javascript:hideTextMedic()" class="link">Medic</a> for the
      most vital class. Using his Stickybombs, he can
      effectively
      shut down a choke or an objective until killed. He generally stays with the <a
        title='group of players which stay close to the Medic'>'combo'</a> to ensure his survival.<br><br>

  <div id="hiddenHighlander" class="hidden">
    <h2>Highlander</h2>
    <p>Gamemodes: Prolander (7v7)* and Highlander (9v9)<br><br>When he is used, the Highlander is usually the main force for
      pushing an enemy point. Due to his high health, he is like a slow moving wall towards an enemy. Without a <a
        href="javascript:hideTextMedic()" class="link">Medic</a>,
      however, he is often easily killed, as his slow speed limits him from playing away from his team.<br><br>
