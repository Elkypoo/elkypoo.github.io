  <p class="intro" style="padding: 3vh; text-align:center;">There are quite a few different competitive gamemodes in
    competitive TF2, all with their own common team compositions known as the <a title='normal team composition of classes for a competitive gamemode'>'meta'</a>. Different leagues also have their own variations, maps, and rules for these gamemodes, 
    so there will be some information on the leagues as well.
    <br><br>
    Some information found on this page is not hard fact, but instead may be opinionated. Be aware there are varying
    opinions in the community and many of these are just some of the most common.<br><br>
    This page uses common competitive vocabulary and slang. Certain words will be within single-quotes (e.g. <a
      title='a definition would normally be here'>'word'</a>). You can hover over these for a small tooltip definition.

    <h2>Ultiduo</h2>
    <p><s>Meta</s> Forced Classes: Soldier and Medic<br><br>
      Ultiduo is always played with two players on each team, a Soldier and a Medic. The maps will always be custom KOTH maps which are very small when compared to other maps.
      The Soldier and Medic both need to be skilled enough to manage player on the offense and defense at all times. A general strategy for this gamemode is for the 
      Medic and Soldier to stay together whenever possible and for the Soldier to always stay nearest to the enemies. Not much else can be said for strategy as the gameplay relies heavily on 
      <a title='the skill of killing people without using gamesense (mostly aiming and prediction)'>'DM (deathmatch) skill'</a>, map knowledge, and callouts.

    <h2>4v4 (a.k.a. Fours or 4s)</h2>
    <p>Meta: Scout, Soldier, Demoman, and Medic<br><br>
      Fours is a competitive format with 4 players on each team (as the name suggests). 
      Class restrictions are usually set to 1 per class and it is most commonly a rule that there cannot be a Heavy and a Medic at the same time on a team. 
      Pyro can also occasionally be played instead of the Soldier. This gamemode usually features smaller maps, most commonly KOTH and smaller 
      <a title='a type of map with 5 control points, 2 for each team and 1 neutral one.'>'5CP'</a> maps.

    <h2>6v6 (a.k.a. Sixes or 6s)</h2>
    <p>Common Meta: Scout (2x), Soldier (2x: Pocket and Roamer), Demoman, and Medic<br><br>
      The most common map types for this gamemode are KOTH and medium-large <a title='a type of map with 5 control points, 2 for each team and 1 neutral one.'>'5CP'</a> maps.
      Commonly referenced as the staple format for competitive TF2, 6v6 has been a community favorite for a long time. 6v6 is by far the most frequently played 
      gamemode in tournaments. It is considered to be the best form of competitive for TF2 and has the largest playerbase of all the gamemodes.<br><br>

      <h2 class="playstyle"> <img style="background-color: rgb(120, 57, 57);" src="images/gamemode_emblems/6s.png" class="playstyle">Standard Sixes</h2>
      <p>Meta: Scout (2x), Soldier (2x: Pocket and Roamer), Demoman, and Medic<br><br>
     There are 6 classes per team in a match, 
      with class restrictions (usually) set to 2 for each class except for Demoman and Medic which are set to 1 per team. Demoman and Medic are the most important 
      classes in this gamemode with Demoman being the team's greatest damage output and with the Medic being the only way for the team to receive healing other than 
      health packs. Getting a kill on one of these are very important and as such, they are usually one of the main focuses in a game.<br><br>The most common strategy is to 
      have a Scout and a Soldier stay by the Demoman and Medic as part of what is called the <a title='group of players which stay close to the Medic'>'combo'</a>. 
      This Scout and Soldier are called Pocket or Combo players (e.g. Pocket Soldier or Combo Scout). The other two players (most commonly a Scout and a Soldier) 
      are known as Flank or Roamer (e.g. Roamer Soldier or Flank Scout). These players will defend the team's flank paths, clean up low-health enemies, and push 
      through the flank paths when preparing for a push.

      <h2 class="playstyle"> <img style="background-color: rgb(57, 120, 83);" src="images/gamemode_emblems/6s.png" class="playstyle">Unrestricted Sixes</h2>
      <p>Due to its unrestrictive nature, there isn't a set meta (yet).<br> 
      Running the standard meta and adapting your composition to combat theirs seems to be an effective strategy currently.<br><br>
      6s is not a community-supported gamemode like the rest either. TF2 has its own implemented competitive mode which is played with 6 players on each team, a different map 
      pool, and no restrictions at all. The restrictions in standard stem from community trial and error, but Valve is attempting to balance around competitive to make a functional 
      gamemode with no restrictions.<br><br>
      Similar to the meta, there isn't very much of a strategy for unrestricted sixes other than the strategy for standard sixes. One thing the lack of restriction changes 
      drastically, however, is reactive team composition. Classes in this gamemode will change based on the enemies', leading to fights of not only deathmatch skill, map-knowledge, 
      or positioning, but also class knowledge and skill as all classes and with all weapons. Based on how skilled one of their players is, you could change your class or your weapon 
      to better combat their playstyle (e.g. if they have a very strong Roamer Soldier, you could change to Pyro and use the Reserve Shooter to shut them down).<br><br>
      RGL (Recharge Gaming League) also offers a No Restriction Sixes gamemode to further experiment with this and to showcase how it can be played.
