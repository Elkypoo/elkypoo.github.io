  <h1 class="single">Classes</h1>
  <p style="padding: 3vh; text-align:center;">There are 9 classes in TF2, as well as many types of competitive
    gamemodes. Certain team compositions are known as
    the 'meta' for that gamemode. It is not set in stone, it is simply a recommendation for what the community has
    found to be the most effective and rewarding.
    <br><br>
    All information found on this page is not hard fact, but instead mostly recommendation. Be aware there are varying
    opinions in the community and these are just some of the most common.</p>

    <h2>Scout</h2>
    <p>Gamemodes: 4v4, 6v6, Prolander (7v7), and Highlander (9v9)<br><br>Scout is, without a doubt, the most versatile
      class of competitive TF2. He is fast, does great close-mid range damage, and can manipulate his movements quickly
      both on
      the ground and in the air. A Scout an absolute necessity to any team in order to deny bombing <a href="javascript:hideTextSoldier()"
        class="link">Soldiers</a>, quickly
      capture points, guide Medics to safety, finish off injured opponents, and wreak absolute havoc on the enemy.<br><br>

  <div id="hiddenSoldier" class="hidden">
    <h2>Soldier</h2>
    <p>Gamemodes: Ultiduo, 4v4, 6v6, Prolander (7v7), and Highlander (9v9)<br><br>
      Competitively, Soldier is very movement oriented.
      Due to his ability to rocket jump, he can roll out quickly and gain higher ground much easier than other classes.
      With this higher ground, he can use his splash damage to slow down choke points, etc...</p>
    <h2 class="playstyle"> <img src="images/class_emblems/pocket.png" class="playstyle"> Pocket Soldier (6v6 only)</h2>
    <p>The primary role of the Pocket Soldier is to protect his team's <a href="javascript:hideTextMedic()" class="link">Medic</a>
      and to use his overheal (from the <a href="javascript:hideTextMedic()" class="link">Medic</a>)
      to deal
      damage, get kills and lead the team. The Pocket Soldier, <a href="javascript:hideTextMedic()" class="link">Medic</a>,
      and <a href="javascript:hideTextDemoman()" class="link">Demoman</a> form what is known as the "combo".
      Usually the Pocket Soldier player is the team's 'main caller' (the most active player in voice-chat, calling when
      to push forward, fall back, or use Über)</p>
    <h2 class="playstyle"> <img src="images/class_emblems/roamer.png" class="playstyle"> Roamer Soldier (6v6 only)</h2>
    <p>The Roamer Soldier's job is to protect his team's flank paths (with the help of a <a href="javascript:hideTextScout()"
        class="link">Scout</a>) and to open up flank
      paths in the enemy's defense. It is not uncommon for the Roamer Soldier to 'bomb' (to Rocket Jump into) or to
      'sac'
      (sacrifice for) important classes like <a href="javascript:hideTextDemoman()" class="link">Demoman</a> and <a
        href="javascript:hideTextMedic()" class="link">Medic</a>. Especially if the <a href="javascript:hideTextMedic()"
        class="link">Medic</a> has his Übercharge, it's best
      to 'force' (force an Übercharge early) or 'drop' (kill before he can use his Über) him to stop the enemy team
      from pushing into an objective or choke.

  <div id="hiddenPyro" class="hidden">
    <h2>Pyro</h2>
    <p>Gamemodes: Prolander (7v7)* and Highlander (9v9)<br><br>Generally, Pyro is a support class.
      The Pyro's main job is to protect the <a href="javascript:hideTextMedic()" class="link">Medic</a>. The Pyro also
      has the job of neutralizing enemy Übers and pushes by
      utilizing their airblast. The Pyro can also play a similar role as the <a href="javascript:hideTextSoldier()"
        class="link">Roaming Soldier</a>, in which they will watch
      their flank and open up paths behind the enemy team for theirs to push in.<br><br>

  <div id="hiddenDemoman" class="hidden">
    <h2>Demoman</h2>
    <p>Gamemodes: 4v4, 6v6, Prolander (7v7) and Highlander (9v9)<br><br>The Demoman has the highest damage output of
      all meta classes throughout the competitive gamemodes. As such, he is consistently played and is one of the most
      important classes in a game, rivaling the <a href="javascript:hideTextMedic()" class="link">Medic</a> for the
      most vital class. Using his Stickybombs, he can
      effectively
      shut down a choke or an objective until killed. He generally stays with the 'combo' to ensure his survival.<br><br>

  </div>

  <div id="hiddenHeavy" class="hidden">
    <h2>Heavy</h2>
    <p>Gamemodes: Prolander (7v7)* and Highlander (9v9)<br><br>When he is used, the Heavy is usually the main force for
      pushing an enemy point. Due to his high health, he is like a slow moving wall towards an enemy. Without a <a href="javascript:hideTextMedic()"
        class="link">Medic</a>,
      however, he is often easily killed, as his slow speed limits him from playing away from his team.<br><br>

  </div>

  <div id="hiddenEngineer" class="hidden">
    <h2>Engineer</h2>
    <p>Gamemodes: Prolander (7v7)* and Highlander (9v9)<br><br>The Engineer is most often played as a defense class due
      to how his Sentry Gun and Dispenser keep him anchored in place. He is also often used on Payload to push the cart
      as he has the least impact when on the offense.<br><br>
      <a href="http://comp.tf/wiki/Engineer" class="link" target="_blank">Comp.TF Page</a>

  <div id="hiddenMedic" class="hidden">
    <h2>Medic</h2>
    <p>Gamemodes: Ultiduo, 4v4, 6v6, Prolander (7v7), and Highlander (9v9)<br><br>The Medic is used always in any
      gamemode. His ability to use his Übercharge or Kritzkreig allows for his team to push much easier. Having a Medic
      is also vital for your <a href="javascript:hideTextSoldier()" class="link">Soldiers'</a> and <a href="javascript:hideTextDemoman()" class="link">Demoman's</a> rollouts. Without a Medic, those classes couldn't get to the
      objective quick enough to have an impact. Because of how important the Übercharge is for the team, it is
      necessary to keep the Medic alive and well-protected (usually through a 'combo' with a <a href="javascript:hideTextSoldier()" class="link">Pocket Soldier</a> and a
      <a href="javascript:hideTextDemoman()" class="link">Demoman</a>).<br><br>
